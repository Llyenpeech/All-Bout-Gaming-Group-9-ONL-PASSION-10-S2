									<dl>
										<dt>Content</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Our streams content will be a gaming stream and podcast wherein we will entertain our viewers by gaming and talking about the gaming issues revolving around the study in the relationship between gaming and procrastination. An analysis on how gaming impacts academic, personal and social performance by delaying students from academic assignments.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Purpose</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Our goal is to educate and inform our target audience which are gamer students to be aware of the dangers and limits of excessive gaming in an online environment as this may effect social, academic and personal performances. </p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Streaming Content Type</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Taking our target audience and the survey result on their preferred content type into consideration, we have chosen Informative Video; includes factual and reliable information and is engaging to the audience. Additionally It's a content type that is versatile meaning we can create a flexible and fun script while providing our viewer's wants, needs and a lot more topics. Our audience's needs also help us form a far more engaging stream; as it makes our stream constructed to their liking. </p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Streaming Platform</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>We have also decided that the most appropriate streaming platform for our topic, content type, target audience and how well our content is likely to spread awareness is YouTube. It is a streaming platform that is used frequently by students to help guide or educate them; they use it to gain informationâ€”generally focusing on the educational aspect. This platform is also accessible to teenagers or students; our target audience. Plus, It's a high quality streaming platform which means we can get feedback and we can connect and engage with our audience.</p>
