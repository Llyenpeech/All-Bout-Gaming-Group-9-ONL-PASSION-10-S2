										<b>Purpose</b>
										<dd>
											<p>Our goal is to <b>educate and inform</b> our target audience which are gamer students to be aware of the dangers and limits of excessive gaming in an online environment as this may effect social, academic and personal performances. </p>
										</dd>
										<b>Streaming Content Type</b>
										<dd>
											<p>Taking our target audience and the survey result on their preferred content type into consideration, we have chosen <b>Informative Video;</b> includes factual and reliable information and is engaging to the audience. Additionally It's a content type that is versatile meaning we can create a flexible and fun script while providing our viewer's wants, needs and a lot more topics. Our audience's needs also help us form a far more engaging stream; as it makes our stream constructed to their liking. </p>
										</dd>
										<b>Streaming Platform</b>
										<dd>
											<p>We have also decided that the most appropriate streaming platform for our topic, content type, target audience and how well our content is likely to spread awareness is <b>YouTube</b>. It is a streaming platform that is used frequently by students to help guide or educate them; they use it to gain informationâ€”generally focusing on the educational aspect. This platform is also accessible to teenagers or students; our target audience. Plus, It's a high quality streaming platform which means we can get feedback and we can connect and engage with our audience.</p>

									<p> For the colors, we used a yellowish-orange as it signifies warmth combined with a dark purple like black to give contrast that makes the colors pop more. This is also for us to have a more engaging as well as interesting overlay that represents our topic. Moreover, since our topic is about gaming and sharing information, we saw that purple and blue signifies reliability and security, we need that as trust and factual data  is a big factor when spreading information. 	Relating to that we chose this font, for its readability and aesthetic; it added a sort of pop and you will be able to tell which is the main or to-be-focused text when presented. It also really matched our theme, color scheme, topic and stream.</p>

									<p>The table and scheduling itself is very straight forward. The schedule itself was designed to be clear and efficient, with all necessary components outlined in each alloted time. We have allocated specific time slots for each discussion topic, taking into account the duration of each topic while we are adjusting it to fit in a span of 2 hours. We have also added the necessary overlays and audio that are supposed to be present in each time frame to avoid errors with the presentation/discussion. Overall, the schedule we have created is easy to follow and allows for a productive and organized discussion of the content at hand.</p>
