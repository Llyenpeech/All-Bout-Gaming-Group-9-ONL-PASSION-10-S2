										<h2>PROMOTIONAL PLAN</h2>
									<p><b>2 methods to promote our stream to our target audience by: </b>
					                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/import1.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>BTS or Behind the Scene</h4>Our first method in advertising or promoting our channel is by creating a behind the scene (BTS) video a day before the livestream. The reason is to make it easier for our target audience to engage with the production since bts scenes make people curious enough to arose interest; or simply to generate buzz and create excitement around the stream or marketing campaign, to build anticipation and driving traffic to the company's website or social media channels allowing our stream to engage with numerous people. Our BTS will consist of our streamers or members in their first time preparing for their very first livestream, buying equipment, funny scenes, bloopers that happened before streaming and more.  </p>
					                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/import2.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>Poster</h4>The second method we have chose in order to advertise or promote our channel is to create a poster for the stream, containing information in the what-when-where our live stream is going to be to inform and persuade viewers to watch the stream. By doing this, we are announcing our stream, which aids in the promotion of our YouTube channel and broadens our audience by boosting visibility, crafting a compelling message, promoting sharing, and helping us build a more distinctive and identifiable brand identity that distinguishes the channel from rivals. This is because by doing this we are producing an eye-catching image graphicary where people are encouraged to watch our stream and increase the chances of our stream to be engaged.</p>										</p>
					                <hr />  
									<h4>Advertise the BTS and Posters in social media platforms </h4> <br>The plan is having to post them on social platforms like facebook, instagram, youtube shorts and more to increase our channels visibility as it increases our brand that leads to an increase in engagement to our the stream. </p>
